I have included one cpp file with the code for the project and a runtime file that I compiled using the g++ command in bash.
This took me the full four hours from the start, but I wasn't able to finish it.
I finished the Arabic to Roman function, but I wasn't able to finish the Roman to Arabic function in the time I was allotted.
I will be finishing this project later by adding the Arabic to Roman function for practice so if you would like to see it, just let me know.

Thank you!

[EDIT]

I finished the program and added the Roman to Arabic function which only took me about 45 minutes to do.
The updated code and runtime file is in the "Updated" file.

As a reflection, I think the hardest part about this was wrapping my head around the roman numeral system and how to tell a computer how to read the system.  But after I figured that out, coding it was pretty easy.
