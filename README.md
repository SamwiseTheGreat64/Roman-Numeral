I have included one cpp file with the code for the project and a runtime file that I compiled using the g++ command in bash.
This took me the full four hours from the start, but I wasn't able to finish it.
I finished the Arabic to Roman function, but I wasn't able to finish the Roman to Arabic function in the time I was allotted.
I will be finishing this project later by adding the Arabic to Roman function for practice so if you would like to see it, just let me know.

Thank you!
